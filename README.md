# logreg_classifier
A vectorized python code for classifying objects based on a set of input features using logistic regression.
The number of input features and the order for the decision boundary polynomial are variable.
The code classifies objects either into two classes ("BinaryClass") or more than two classes ("MultiClass")
using a combination of binary classifications.
